Alt-Ergo Zero is an OCaml library for an SMT solver. This SMT solver
is derived from Alt-Ergo. It uses an efficient SAT solver and supports
the following quantifier free theories:
    - Equality and uninterpreted functions
    - Arithmetic (linear, non-linear, integer, real)
    - Enumerated data-types

This API makes heavy use of hash consing, in particular hash-consed strings.

INSTALLATION
============
To compile Alt-Ergo Zero you will need OCaml version 3.11 (or newer).

Uncompress the archive and do:
     cd aez-0.3
     ./configure
     make

then with superuser rigths:
     make install


USAGE
=====

The documentation generated by ocamldoc is available in the repertory doc/.

To use Alt-Ergo Zero in the toplevel you must give ocaml (or ocamlc)
the options -I +alt-ergo-zero unix.cma nums.cma aez.cma. To compile
natively you must use -I +alt-ergo-zero unix.cmxa nums.cmxa aez.cmxa.
